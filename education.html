       <p>
        Government Day Junior Secondary School, Duddaye, was officially re-established on April 18, 2023.

        However, the Local Government Education Authority (LGEA) intervened, providing the school with necessary furniture 
        in November 2023.
        Interestingly, the school has a prior history, dating back to 2006. 
        Unfortunately, it was forced to close due to inadequate infrastructure, insufficient teachers, and 
        other challenges. Fortunately, the school has been revitalized, and it's now fully operational, 
        offering a fresh start for students and staff alike.
