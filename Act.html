        It is a Known fact that any traditional entity has its peculiar
        organizational and structural settings, though most emirates in the
        region are homogeneous in nature as a result of common origin and
        religious background. In the case of Tikau Emirate, Mai Tikau (HRH
        Alhaji Abubakar Muhammadu Ibn Grema) is regarded as the spirtual and
        head of the Emirate. He is also the highest commanding officer of the
        traditional administration of the Emirate. Right from the emergence of
        Tikau Dynasty, It has been a tradition that a ruler is crown through
        succession and endorsement by kingmakers, but when Tikau was elevated to
        the status of emirate, the process got some additional requirements,
        thus, after successful endorsement by the Tikau Emirate Kingmakers, The
        state Governor has final approval, subsequently the installation is done
        in accordance with the Tradition, culture and religion of Tikau people.
        Mai Tikau (HRH Alhaji Abubakar Muhammadu Ibn Grema) is the chairman of
        Tikau Emirate Council, which is regarded as the apex decision making
        body in the Tikau Traditional Settings. However, the Emir of Tikau is to
        Appoint District Heads (Ajiyas/Hakimai), though his appointment is
        subjected to final approval of the state Governor. on the other hand,
        Village Heads and Ward Heads are nominated by their respective district
        heads for final approval by the Emir. In the case of appointment of
        heads of Departments and traditional title holders such as: Waziri,
        Ciroma, Galadima, Madaki, Turaki, Talba, Wali, Kachalla, e.t.c The Emir
        has the sole power to appoint compentent personality, based on the
        norms, value and culture of the Emirate. Usually, These appointments are
        followed with traditional turbaning ceremony which normally holds at the
        Emirs Palace. Since the olden days, the Tikau traditional and
        Administrative setting has been highly respected and obeyed by the
        locals, especially considering the fact that it has been usually more
        accessible to the ordinary people than government officials or elected
        politicians. Hence, the community regarded and respect this traditional
        institution more than the present modern Political Institution.
